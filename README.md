# Gmail Triage Agent (Gemini Powered)

A powerful Google Apps Script that leverages Google's Gemini AI to intelligently triage your inbox. Working in two stages—**Triage** and **Drafting**—this agent analyzes your incoming mail, prioritizes urgent matters, and drafts context-aware replies that mimic your personal writing style.

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This code was "vibe coded" and uses AI to perform actions on your email. Use at your own risk. Always verify AI actions before enabling destructive settings.**

## Features

-   **Two-Stage Intelligence**: 
    1.  **Triage**: Rapidly categorizes emails (`STAR`, `DRAFT_REPLY`, `ARCHIVE`, `BLOCK`, `UNSURE`).
    2.  **Drafting**: Generates sophisticated draft replies for candidates identified in the Triage stage.
-   **Context Aware**: Analyzes your recent sent emails and Trello board notifications to understand your current projects and VIP contacts.
-   **Style Mimicry**: Extracts tone and formatting patterns from your sent folder to ensure drafts sound like you.
-   **Safety First**: "Destructive" actions (Archive/Block) are disabled by default; the AI will only apply labels (`ai_archive`, `ai_block`) for your review.
-   **Webhook Notifications**: Instantly alerts you via custom webhooks for urgent, time-sensitive emails.
-   **Batch Efficiency**: Intelligently queues emails to process them in batches, saving API tokens and execution time.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Create the Google Apps Script Project
1.  Visit [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/) and create a **New Project**.
2.  In the Apps Script editor, create files corresponding to the `.js` files in this repository and copy their contents:
    -   `Config.js`
    -   `ContextBuilder.js`
    -   `GeminiOrchestrator.js`
    -   `Main.js`
    -   `Prompts.js`

### 2. Configure Script Properties
The agent uses **Script Properties** to securely store sensitive data.
1.  Click the **Project Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar.
2.  Scroll to **Script Properties** and click **Edit script properties**.
3.  Add the following required and optional properties:
    -   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Get your key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    -   `WEBHOOK_URL` (Optional): A URL for push notifications (e.g., Zapier, Pushover).

### 3. Customize Configuration
Fine-tune the agent's behavior in `Config.js` and `Prompts.js`.

#### `Config.js` - Core Settings
The logic respects the following categories of settings:

- **Sources & Labels**:
  - `SOURCE_LABELS`: Queries identifying emails to triage (e.g., `is:unread in:inbox`).
  - `LABELS`: Mapping of outcomes to Gmail labels (e.g., `STAR -> ai_star`).
- **Context & Exclusions**:
  - `TRELLO_LABEL`: The Gmail label applied to Trello notifications. The agent extracts board names for project context. Set to `null` to disable.
  - `EXCLUDED_DOMAINS`: List of domains/emails to ignore for context building (e.g., automation bots).
- **Safety & Destructive Actions**:
  - `ENABLE_DESTRUCTIVE_ACTIONS`: Set to `true` to allow the AI to automatically Archive or Trash emails. If `false`, it only applies labels.
- **Batching (Token Optimization)**:
  - `MIN_BATCH_SIZE`: Minimum emails required to trigger a run (e.g., `5`).
  - `MAX_WAIT_TIME_MINUTES`: Force a run if this time has passed, even if the batch isn't full (e.g., `30`).
  - `MAX_EMAILS_TO_PROCESS`: Hard limit on threads per execution to avoid script timeouts (default: `30`).

#### `Prompts.js` - Personalization
**CRITICAL**: You must adjust the prompts to match your identity.
-  `PROMPTS.TRIAGE`: Used in **Stage 1**. Defines the criteria for importance and identifies which emails need a response (`draft_reply`).
-  `PROMPTS.DRAFTING`: Used in **Stage 2**. Contains instructions for tone, voice, and sign-offs. **Replace "Nik" with your name** and adjust the strategic consultant persona to fit your role.

## Webhook Configuration & Output (Optional)

- **Config.gs settings**:
  - `WEBHOOK_MODE`: Choose between `JSON` (full data), `TEXT` (short alert), or `URL_PARAM` (GET request).
  - `WEBHOOK_PARAM_NAME`: The parameter name used for `URL_PARAM` mode (default: `message`).

When an urgent email is identified (`notify: true`), the agent triggers your configured `WEBHOOK_URL`.

### Output Formats:
- **`JSON` (Default)**:
  ```json
  {
    "messageId": "msg_id",
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "sender": "sender@example.com",
    "geminiOutput": { "importance": "STAR", "reason": "...", "notification_text": "..." },
    "timestamp": "2024-02-16T..."
  }
  ```
- **`TEXT`**: A simple string containing the `notification_text` generated by Gemini as text/raw payload.
- **`URL_PARAM`**: A `GET` request to your URL with the message appended as a query parameter (e.g., `?message=hello%20world...`).

## Schedule to Run Automatically

Set up triggers in the Apps Script dashboard (Clock icon):
1.  **`refreshContextCache`**: Time-driven -> Minutes timer -> Every 30 minutes. (Keeps your project/style context fresh).
2.  **`processIncomingMail`**: Time-driven -> Minutes timer -> Every 5 minutes. (The main triage loop). Note that this is limited by batch size, so higher frequency will not incur additional costs.
